SECTION
Education



PROBLEM
In someways we have faced the problem where children are not quite living to their potentials because they are either not understood by their teachers, schools or the teaching methods applied by their educational structures. Many a times too, teachers are more concerned aout the number of students that enrolls to their schools and they then get overworked by trying to keep up with the records of students, parents, school activites and the structure of the school. With this division of attention, a less qualitative education is given to the children making them average or even below average. Also, Africa at large is constantly increasing and would have doubled its current size by the year 2050. This means there will be a size problem, maybe too many students in a classroom, too many documents to handle and that is a stress on the teacher's and school management's, leading to a poor rendering of education.



PROPOSED SOLUTION
We want to help maximize the creativity of Children in every form. If teachers can bother less about files, students documents, school documents etc. They can maximize their service delivery ability.
They can focus on helping children discover the best they can be, thereby creating a more powerful society that can solve its in-house problems with less dependence on foreign aids because they have the manpower and willpower to do so.



PROPOSED STACK
Web, Mobile
